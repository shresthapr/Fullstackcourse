<p>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer <br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br>

No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>

That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause—there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life.<br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,<br>
The insolence of office, and the spurns <br>
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn<br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry<br>
And lose the name of action.<br>
